# Abstract

Cancer prediction based on simple demographic and lifestyle factors is an important task, especially in settings where detailed clinical or genomic data are unavailable. The public “Cancer Prediction” dataset provides routinely collected variables—such as age, BMI, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and genetic risk—that can be used to study how well common machine learning methods distinguish cancer from non-cancer cases.

Previous work has mainly compared individual models on this dataset, often showing strong performance from tree-based ensembles. However, these studies rarely address class imbalance or explore whether combining models can improve performance while remaining interpretable.

In this project, we compare several statistical and machine learning models under a unified framework and investigate a stacked logistic regression approach that integrates random forest and gradient boosting outputs. Our goal is to assess whether stacking can enhance prediction accuracy and F1-score over a baseline logistic regression while maintaining interpretability and computational feasibility.

# Introduction

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and early identification of individuals at elevated risk is essential for prevention and timely intervention [@KOUROU20158]. In many real-world settings, comprehensive clinical or genomic data may not be available, and risk assessment must rely on routinely collected demographic and lifestyle variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, genetic risk, and cancer history. Understanding how well these simple predictors can distinguish individuals with and without cancer is therefore of both scientific and practical relevance.

The public “Cancer Prediction” dataset used in this project has been widely analyzed in previous machine learning studies. Most prior work evaluates the performance of individual models—such as logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, or gradient boosting—on this dataset, often reporting strong accuracy for tree-based ensemble methods [@10.1145/1143844.1143865]. However, these analyses typically evaluate models in isolation and do not explore how different learners might be combined. Moreover, many studies emphasize overall accuracy despite mild class imbalance, even though metrics such as recall and F1-score carry more clinical importance due to the cost of missed cancer cases [@10.1371/journal.pone.0118432].

This project has two primary goals. The first is to systematically compare classical statistical models and modern machine learning methods for binary cancer prediction under a consistent cross-validation framework. The second is to investigate whether combining strong ensemble models through a stacked logistic regression meta-model can improve predictive performance while retaining interpretability. Stacking allows non-linear models, such as random forest and gradient boosting, to capture complex relationships in the data, while logistic regression provides a transparent final layer that summarizes their contributions.

In addition to evaluating predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out test set, we also consider the computational challenges involved in training and tuning multiple machine learning models [@10.1371/journal.pone.0118432]. We make use of parallel cross-validation to reduce runtime and briefly discuss how such analyses could be scaled to larger health datasets. Through this study, we aim to demonstrate both methodological and computational aspects of applying machine learning to a real-world health problem.

# Data

## Dataset Description

The dataset comes from the publicly released “Cancer Prediction Dataset” on Kaggle. It is an original synthetic dataset published under the CC BY 4.0 license with a registered DOI, designed to mimic plausible risk relationships that appear in epidemiological studies, which enhances its suitability for exploring how machine learning could assist cancer risk assessment when applied to real data in the future.

The dataset contains 1,500 individuals and follows a case–control structure, including cancer cases and non-cancer controls. Predictors include four continuous variables (Age, BMI, Physical activity, alcohol intake), three binary variables (Gender, Smoking, CancerHistory), and one three-level categorical variable (GeneticRisk). The outcome variable, Diagnosis, indicates cancer status.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Continuous variables were within reasonable ranges and had no missing values. By cancer status, the cancer group tended to be older, have a higher BMI, consume more alcohol, and have lower levels of physical activity. Categorical variables also showed significant differences between different categories. Smoking and cancer history showed moderate differences among individuals, while genetic risk was mainly concentrated in the low-risk category.

The outcome was slightly imbalanced (roughly 60% non-cancer, 40% cancer), motivating evaluation metrics beyond raw accuracy (e.g., F1). Weak correlations between continuous predictors and the outcome suggest that non-linear models may capture more structure.
